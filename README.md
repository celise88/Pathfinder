## Purpose: 
#### This is a web application designed to allow job-seekers to learn more about various occupations and explore their future career path. See below for details and page descriptions. If you like the app, please star and/or fork and check back frequently for future releases. 

Note: This is an in-progress FastAPI version of the "ONET-Application" Flask app in my repo.

## Version history:
 
* Initial commit - 2/3/2023 - Allows users to select a job title to learn more about and get a brief description of the selected job and the major tasks involved, which is dynamically scraped from https://onetonline.org. The job neighborhoods page was generated by using Co:here AI's LLM to embed ONET's task statements and subsequently performing dimension reduction using t-SNE to get a 2-D representation of job "clusters." The distance between jobs in the plot corresponds to how similar they are to one another - i.e., more similar jobs (according to the tasks involved in the job) will appear more closely "clustered" on the plot.
